Hi! I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the <a href='https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/CVL.html'>Computer Vision Lab, Virginia Tech</a>. My advisor is <a href='http://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh'>Devi Parikh</a>. I am broadly interested in computer vision and machine learning.

On the vision side, I am interested in problems in vision and language, learning common sense and visual reasoning. On the machine learning side, I am interested in developing tools for effective low-shot learning, generative models, bayesian deep learning and variational inference.

I also care about issues of how we evaluate our models, as we edge towards higher-level AI-complete tasks. In my first project in grad school, I worked on a (now popularly used) evaluation metric for image captioning called <a href="http://vrama91.github.io/cider/">CIDEr</a>. 

I have been fortunate to work with some great mentors and collaborators during grad school, including <a href="http://larryzitnick.org/">Larry Zitnick</a>,

<a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~gal/">Gal Chechik</a>, and <a href="http://bengio.abracadoudou.com/">Samy Bengio</a>.

In a previous life, I was an undergrad in ECE at IIIT-Hyderabad where I worked with <a href='http://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna'>K. Madhava Krishna</a> in Robotics. <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/vrama91/'>Here</a> is a link to my old website.
